# Automate Salmon Monitoring

In this collaborative project, we are developing advanced hardware and software
to monitor salmon populations. Our innovative solution integrates data from
underwater cameras, sonar, and drones, harnessing state-of-the-art AI
technology to enable precise and automated counting of salmon in rivers like
never before.
<br/>
<br/>

## Key Features

- 🎥 **Hardware Monitoring**: A combination of sonar, underwater cameras, and
drones works in unison to provide precise tracking of salmon populations.
- 🧠 **Computer Vision**: Advanced AI models analyze incoming data to predict the
location and species of fish, enhancing real-time monitoring capabilities.
- 📊 **Data Analysis**: Comprehensive population count reports are generated and
can be easily exported for further analysis and decision-making.
