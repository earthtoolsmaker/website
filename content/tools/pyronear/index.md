## Wildfire Early Real Time Detection System

Pyronear is a complete fire risk management solution. It consists of an early
wildfire detection algorithm, implemented on a microcomputer, connected to
cameras positioned on high spots with a view on the forest. The detectors
communicate fire alerts to a database that is connected to a supervision
platform for fire departments.

## Key Features

- ðŸ§  __Cutting-Edge AI Model__: Advanced computer vision models are designed to
detect wildfires in real time. These models continuously improve their accuracy
through regular retraining with incoming data.
- ðŸ”¥ __Web Fire Management Platform__: An intuitive web application that
showcases recent fire alerts and enhances fire management efficiency for fire
departments.
