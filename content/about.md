Welcome to EarthToolsMaker, a pioneering European-based organization
dedicated to leveraging and developing open-source technology for
global conservation efforts. At EarthToolsMaker, we are committed to
advancing the common good through innovative research and development
initiatives.

Our mission is clear: to develop open and impact-driven conservation
technologies tailored to the needs of conservation organizations
worldwide. By harnessing the power of open solutions, we strive to
provide accessible, cost-effective, and dependable tools that empower
the global conservation community.


Collaboration and transparency are essential for achieving our shared
goal of preserving our planet's biodiversity. Through our dedication to
open-source principles, we aim to foster a culture of innovation and
cooperation that transcends borders and disciplines.

> Together, let's embark on a journey to better conserve, monitor, and
> protect our beautiful planet and to safeguard the
> natural world for future generations.

## What We Offer

We build custom conservation tools adapted to your specific needs and datasets, empowering organizations with actionable environmental insights. Our expertise spans the full development lifecycle—from data collection and model training to deployment and maintenance.

### Our Services

- **Custom AI/ML Model Development**: We design and train machine learning models tailored to your conservation challenges, whether it's species identification, behavior detection, or environmental monitoring.

- **Data Pipeline & Processing**: We build efficient systems to process large-scale datasets—terabytes of audio, video, or sensor data—turning raw information into meaningful insights.

- **Deployment & Integration**: We deliver production-ready solutions that integrate with your existing infrastructure, from edge devices in the field to cloud-based platforms.

- **Open-Source Tools**: Most of our work is open-source, ensuring transparency, reproducibility, and long-term sustainability for your organization.

### Concrete Examples

<div class="services-table">

| Challenge | Solution | Impact | Partners |
|-----------|----------|--------|----------|
| [**Tracking forest elephants**](/projects/elephants_passive_acoustic_monitoring/) in dense rainforests | Developed an [acoustic analyzer](/projects/elephants_passive_acoustic_monitoring/) that processes audio data at scale—1TB (1 month of recordings) in ~8 hours | Enables the [Elephant Listening Project](https://www.elephantlisteningproject.org/) and [Cornell Lab](https://www.birds.cornell.edu/) to monitor populations and detect poaching threats | ![Elephant Listening Project](/images/clients/elephantlistening/logo.png) ![Cornell Lab](/images/clients/cornell_lab/logo.svg) |
| [**Monitoring salmon migration**](/projects/wild_salmon_migration_monitoring/) across rivers | Built [SalmonVision](/projects/wild_salmon_migration_monitoring/)—a computer vision system using underwater cameras, sonar, and drones to automatically count and classify 7+ salmon species | Enables precise population tracking for the [Pacific Salmon Foundation](https://psf.ca/) and [Wild Salmon Center](https://wildsalmoncenter.org/) | ![PSF](/images/clients/psf/logo.png) ![Wild Salmon Center](/images/clients/wild_salmon_centre/logo.png) |
| [**Detecting forest fires early**](/projects/early_forest_fire_detection/) | Enhanced [Pyronear's](/projects/early_forest_fire_detection/) ML model for real-time fire detection from tower-mounted cameras, minimizing false alarms | Deployed with [Pyronear](https://pyronear.org), detecting fires from 35km away, protecting forests in Fontainebleau | ![Pyronear](/images/clients/pyronear/logo.png) |
