Marine biologists engaged in the study of coral reefs invest a significant
portion of their time in manually processing data obtained from research dives.
The objective of this collaboration is to create an image segmentation pipeline
that accelerates the analysis of such data. This endeavor aims to assist
conservationists and researchers in enhancing their efforts to protect and
comprehend these vital ocean ecosystems. Leveraging computer vision for the
segmentation of coral reefs in benthic imagery holds the potential to quantify
the long-term growth or decline of coral cover within marine protected areas.

Monitoring coral reefs is fundamental for efficient management, with swift
reporting being critical for timely guidance. Although underwater photography
has significantly enhanced the precision and pace of data gathering, the
bottleneck in reporting results persists due to image processing.

## Coral reefs play a crucial role in maintaining the health of our planet

Coral reefs are incredibly important for several reasons:

- __Biodiversity Hotspots__: Coral reefs are among the most biodiverse
ecosystems on the planet, providing a home for an estimated 25% of all marine
species despite covering less than 1% of the ocean floor. They offer habitat,
breeding grounds, and shelter for numerous marine organisms, from fish to
invertebrates.
- __Economic Value__: Coral reefs support a vast array of industries and
economies worldwide. They are crucial for fisheries, tourism, and coastal
protection. Millions of people depend on coral reefs for food, livelihoods, and
income through activities such as fishing and tourism.
- __Coastal Protection__: Coral reefs act as natural barriers that help protect
coastal communities from storms, waves, and erosion. They absorb and dissipate
wave energy, reducing the impact of storms and protecting shorelines from
damage.
- __Carbon Cycling and Climate Regulation__: Coral reefs play a role in the
global carbon cycle by sequestering carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. They
also help regulate the Earth's climate by influencing oceanic and atmospheric
circulation patterns.
- __Medicinal Resources__: Coral reef organisms produce compounds that have
potential pharmaceutical applications. These include treatments for cancer,
pain, and other diseases. Research into coral reef organisms continues to
uncover new compounds with medicinal properties.
- __Recreational and Educational Value__: Coral reefs attract millions of
tourists each year who engage in activities such as snorkeling, diving, and
reef exploration. These experiences foster appreciation for marine ecosystems
and can contribute to conservation efforts.
- __Cultural Importance__: Coral reefs hold significant cultural value for many
indigenous and coastal communities around the world. They are often central to
cultural practices, traditions, and spiritual beliefs, serving as important
symbols of identity and connection to the sea.

Overall, coral reefs are not only ecologically significant but also
economically, socially, and culturally important. Protecting and preserving
coral reefs is essential for the health of marine ecosystems and the well-being
of human societies that depend on them.

## Conservation concerns

There are several reasons why coral reef conservation is a matter of concern:

- __Climate Change__: Rising sea temperatures due to climate change lead to
coral bleaching, where corals expel the symbiotic algae living in their
tissues, causing them to turn white and become more susceptible to disease and
mortality. Ocean acidification, another consequence of climate change, can also
weaken coral skeletons, making them more vulnerable to damage.
- __Pollution__: Pollution from land-based sources, such as agricultural
runoff, sewage, and marine debris, can smother corals, introduce harmful
chemicals, and promote the growth of algae that compete with corals for space.
Chemical pollutants can weaken corals' immune systems and make them more
susceptible to disease.
- __Overfishing and Destructive Fishing Practices__: Overfishing of herbivorous
fish species, such as parrotfish and surgeonfish, can disrupt the delicate
balance of coral reef ecosystems by allowing algae to overgrow corals.
Destructive fishing practices, such as blast fishing and cyanide fishing,
directly damage coral reefs and reduce fish populations.
- __Coastal Development and Habitat Destruction__: Coastal development,
including the construction of resorts, ports, and coastal infrastructure, can
lead to habitat destruction through dredging, sedimentation, and pollution
runoff. Deforestation and land clearing also contribute to sedimentation and
nutrient runoff that can harm coral reefs.
- __Unsustainable Tourism__: Unsustainable tourism practices, such as anchoring
on reefs, trampling fragile corals, and overuse of snorkeling and diving sites,
can damage coral reefs and disturb marine life. In some cases, the extraction
of marine organisms for souvenirs or aquarium trade can also negatively impact
coral reef ecosystems.
- __Invasive Species__: Introduction of non-native species, either
intentionally or accidentally, can disrupt coral reef ecosystems by
outcompeting native species for resources, preying on native species, or
altering habitat structure.
- __Lack of Awareness and Governance__: Limited public awareness about the
importance of coral reefs and inadequate governance and enforcement of
conservation measures contribute to continued degradation of coral reef
ecosystems.

Addressing these conservation concerns requires concerted efforts at local,
national, and international levels, including sustainable management practices,
marine protected areas, pollution reduction measures, and climate change
mitigation strategies.

## Project Scope and Objectives

Our collaboration aims to pioneer the development of an advanced underwater
benthic imagery model capable of accurately identifying and localizing various
functional groups inhabiting reef ecosystems. This model is designed to be
versatile, adaptable to diverse marine regions worldwide.

Initially, our focus is on distinguishing between hard and soft coral species.
However, our iterative approach allows for the gradual incorporation of more
detailed taxonomic classifications as the system matures and gains
sophistication. By laying a robust foundation with this generalized framework,
we pave the way for comprehensive reef ecosystem analysis and management.

## Challenges in underwater imagery

Computer vision tasks in underwater imagery pose unique challenges that make
them particularly difficult. Here are some key reasons:

- __Limited Light and Color Variation:__ Underwater environments typically
   have limited light penetration, leading to reduced visibility and color
distortion. The attenuation of light in water results in diminished contrast
and color richness, making it challenging for computer vision models to
accurately perceive and differentiate objects.
- __Scattering and Absorption:__ Water causes scattering and absorption of
   light, which can obscure details and create hazy or blurry images. This
phenomenon is exacerbated as the distance from the camera increases, impacting
the clarity of objects in the scene. The scattering of light can also cause
objects to appear larger or closer than they are.
- __Complex Backgrounds:__ Underwater scenes often feature intricate and
   dynamic backgrounds, such as coral reefs, plants, and marine life. The
complexity of these backgrounds can make it challenging for computer vision
models to distinguish between the objects of interest and the surrounding
environment.
- __Limited Annotated Data:__ Annotating underwater imagery for training
   machine learning models is a labor-intensive process. The scarcity of large
and well-annotated datasets specific to underwater scenes makes it difficult to
train models effectively. Limited training data can lead to challenges in
achieving robust generalization.
- __Distinctive Visual Artifacts:__ Underwater imagery may exhibit visual
   artifacts such as caustics, backscatter, and particulate matter in the
water. These artifacts can introduce noise and irregularities, impacting the
performance of computer vision algorithms.
- __Variable Environmental Conditions:__ Underwater conditions are highly
   variable, including changes in water clarity, currents, and turbulence.
These variations can affect the quality and consistency of images, making it
difficult for models trained on one set of conditions to generalize well across
different scenarios.
- __Lack of Standardization:__ Unlike many computer vision tasks on land,
   there is less standardization in underwater imaging equipment and
techniques. Different cameras, lighting setups, and environmental conditions
can lead to a wide range of image characteristics, complicating the development
of universally applicable models.

Addressing these challenges in underwater computer vision requires specialized
techniques, data augmentation strategies, and innovative algorithms tailored to
the unique characteristics of underwater imagery. Advances in this field have
the potential to contribute significantly to marine biology, environmental
monitoring, and underwater exploration.
