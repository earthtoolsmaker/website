## Context

Forest elephants play a crucial role as ecosystem
engineers within Central Africa's tropical rainforests.
However, their populations are dwindling due to ivory
poaching, which not only diminishes their numbers but
also reduces the rainforest's capacity to sequester
carbon, impacting the global environment. Furthermore,
habitat loss and changing climate conditions force
elephants to encroach on villages, leading to conflicts
between humans and wildlife.

Conservation efforts face significant challenges,
particularly in monitoring forest elephants within the
dense rainforest environment. Acoustic monitoring offers
a promising solution for tracking these elusive yet
acoustically conspicuous creatures. Central to this
approach are accurate and efficient detection algorithms
and data retrieval systems, which must be user-friendly
for conservation practitioners. These tools not only aid
in monitoring population trends and landscape use
patterns but also support anti-poaching initiatives and
mitigate human-elephant conflicts.

## Project Scope and Objectives

Our collaboration is dedicated to enhancing the Machine Learning models
utilized by the [Elephant Listening
Project](https://www.elephantlisteningproject.org). These models are
designed to harness sound recordings to accurately detect elephant
rumble
vocalizations and distinguish them from gunshots within the Central
African rainforest. Our goal is to meticulously refine and optimize
these models, constructing an automated pipeline that prioritizes model
efficiency and effectiveness. By focusing solely on algorithmic
improvements, we streamline the process without the need for intricate
hardware integration.
