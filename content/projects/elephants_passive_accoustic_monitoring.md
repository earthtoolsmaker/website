## ðŸ˜‡ Looking for Funding

Forest elephants play a crucial role as ecosystem
engineers within Central Africa's tropical rainforests.
However, their populations are dwindling due to ivory
poaching, which not only diminishes their numbers but
also reduces the rainforest's capacity to sequester
carbon, impacting the global environment. Furthermore,
habitat loss and changing climate conditions force
elephants to encroach on villages, leading to conflicts
between humans and wildlife.

Conservation efforts face significant challenges,
particularly in monitoring forest elephants within the
dense rainforest environment. Acoustic monitoring offers
a promising solution for tracking these elusive yet
acoustically conspicuous creatures. Central to this
approach are accurate and efficient detection algorithms
and data retrieval systems, which must be user-friendly
for conservation practitioners. These tools not only aid
in monitoring population trends and landscape use
patterns but also support anti-poaching initiatives and
mitigate human-elephant conflicts.
