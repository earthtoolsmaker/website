Forest elephants are rapidly disappearing, with over 60%
lost in the past decade and more than 12,000 killed
annually for their ivory. Despite these alarming
statistics, there is hope for their survival through
immediate action.

A critical challenge in conserving forest elephants is
the lack of essential data. We currently have
insufficient knowledge about where elephant populations
are located over time and space, as well as inadequate
data on patterns of poaching. These gaps are crucial for
developing effective conservation and anti-poaching
strategies, especially in the expansive forests of
Central Africa where prioritizing protection is
essential.

## Vital Roles of Forest Elephants in Ecosystems

Forest elephants of Africa play a crucial role in maintaining the health
and balance of their ecosystems. Here are several reasons why they are
vital:

- __Seed Dispersal:__ Forest elephants are key seed dispersers. They
consume a variety of fruits and plants, and their movement through the
forest helps in spreading seeds over large areas. This promotes forest
regeneration and diversity, ensuring the survival of many plant species.
- __Habitat Modification:__ As they move through the forest, forest
elephants create clearings and pathways. This behavior helps in
maintaining a mosaic of different habitats, which supports a variety of
plant and animal species. Their foraging activities also prevent any
single species from becoming too dominant, thus maintaining ecological
balance.
- __Nutrient Cycling:__ By feeding on various plants and depositing
dung, forest elephants help recycle nutrients within the forest
ecosystem. Their dung is rich in nutrients and serves as a fertilizer,
enhancing soil fertility and promoting plant growth. It also provides
food for a range of other organisms, including insects and fungi.
- __Water Distribution:__ Forest elephants often dig for water in dry
riverbeds, creating water holes that are crucial for many other species
during dry periods. These water sources are vital for the survival of
numerous animals and help sustain the biodiversity of the forest.
- __Biodiversity Support:__ The presence of forest elephants supports a
wide range of biodiversity. By maintaining diverse and dynamic habitats,
they provide the necessary conditions for various plant and animal
species to thrive. This biodiversity is essential for ecosystem
resilience and stability.
- __Climate Regulation:__ Forests where elephants live are important
carbon sinks. By promoting forest growth and regeneration through their
activities, elephants help in sequestering carbon dioxide, thus playing
a role in mitigating climate change.

In summary, forest elephants are ecosystem engineers whose activities
support the structure, function, and biodiversity of their habitats.
Their conservation is not only crucial for their survival but also for
the health of the entire ecosystem they inhabit.

## Conservation Threats to Forest Elephants

Forest elephants face significant threats that challenge their survival
and conservation efforts. In addition to the widespread issues of
poaching for ivory and habitat loss, these elephants are increasingly
pressured by hunting for meat, accelerating natural resource extraction,
and a lack of development in ecotourism that could provide alternative
economic value. Combined with their slow reproductive rate, these
factors create immense challenges for conservation.

### Ivory Poaching

Forest elephant ivory is highly prized, particularly for its hardness and
distinctive rose-colored tint, making it ideal for carving and demanding higher
prices in the marketplace. This preference is especially strong in Japan, where
"harder" ivory has dominated the trade for decades. Premium quality bachi,
traditional Japanese plucking tools for the shamisen, are made exclusively from
forest elephant tusks.

Poaching is particularly difficult to detect in the dense rainforests of
Central Africa. Most estimates of poaching levels come from ivory seizures at
ports, which have been increasing. As anti-poaching efforts in East and
Southern Africa become more effective, Central Africa's sparsely populated and
poorly protected forests have become more attractive to organized poachers.
However, improved anti-poaching systems in places like Nouabalé-Ndoki National
Park in Congo are beginning to show positive results, with more poachers being
successfully prosecuted.

### Bushmeat Trade

Ivory is not the only driver of forest elephant poaching. The bushmeat trade
has become an international business, with markets for African rainforest
animals extending to major cities in the U.S. Hunting forest elephants for
bushmeat is on the rise, posing a grave threat to elephants of all ages,
including calves. Local economies often rely on bushmeat for protein, but
growing human populations have made this practice unsustainable. Efforts to
reduce the bushmeat trade include establishing checkpoints on major roads and
key railroad stations to disrupt commercial networks and control vehicle access
to remote areas.

### Natural Resource Extraction

The extraction of natural resources such as wood, minerals, and oil poses
severe threats to forest elephants. Logging is currently the most pervasive
industry, with selective logging often creating small openings that can benefit
forest elephants by promoting new vegetation growth. However, the construction
of roads for resource extraction increases access for hunters and the number of
people living in the forest. The demand for sustainable wood products has led
to improvements, such as internationally recognized certification for large
companies, but these measures do not yet include requirements to close roads
and monitor access by private vehicles.

## Elephant Rumbles

Elephant rumbles are low-frequency vocalizations produced by elephants,
primarily for communication.

![Spectrogram Elephant Rumbles](/images/projects/forest_elephants_passive_acoustic_monitoring/spectrograms/rumbles_intro.png "Spectrogram of elephant rumbles")
*Gallery / Spectrogram of elephant rumbles*

These rumbles are a fundamental part of elephant
social interactions and serve various purposes within their groups. Here’s a
detailed explanation:

### Characteristics of Elephant Rumbles

- __Low Frequency__: Elephant rumbles typically fall in the infrasound range,
   below 20 Hz, which is often below the threshold of human hearing. However,
some rumbles can also be heard by humans as a low, throaty sound.
- __Long Distance Communication__: Due to their low frequency, rumbles can
   travel long distances, sometimes several kilometers, allowing elephants to
communicate with each other across vast areas, even when they are out of sight.
It can also travel through dense forests as the wavelength is very large.
- __Vocal Production__: Rumbles are produced by the larynx and can vary in
   frequency, duration, and modulation. Elephants use different types of
rumbles to convey different messages.

### Functions of Elephant Rumbles

- __Coordination and Social Bonding__: Elephants use rumbles to maintain
   contact with members of their herd, coordinate movements, and reinforce
social bonds. For example, a matriarch might use a rumble to lead her group to
a new location.
- __Reproductive Communication__: Male elephants, or bulls, use rumbles to
   communicate their reproductive status and readiness to mate. Females also
use rumbles to signal their estrus status to potential mates.
- __Alarm and Distress Calls__: Rumbles can signal alarm or distress, warning
   other elephants of potential danger. These rumbles can mobilize the herd and
prompt protective behavior.
- __Mother-Calf Communication__: Mothers and calves use rumbles to stay in
   contact, especially when they are separated. Calves may rumble to signal
hunger or distress, prompting a response from their mothers.

### Importance of Understanding Elephant Rumbles

- __Conservation Efforts__: Understanding elephant communication helps in
   conservation efforts by providing insights into their social structure,
habitat needs, and responses to environmental changes.
- __Human-Elephant Conflict Mitigation__: By recognizing alarm rumbles,
   conservationists can better manage and mitigate conflicts between humans and
elephants, especially in regions where their habitats overlap.
- __Enhancing Animal Welfare__: For elephants in captivity, understanding
   their rumbles can help caretakers improve their welfare by addressing their
social and environmental needs more effectively.

Overall, elephant rumbles are a vital aspect of their complex communication
system, reflecting the sophistication of their social interactions and the
importance of acoustic signals in their daily lives.

## Project Scope and Objectives

Fifty microphones are arranged in a grid within the Tropical Forest of Central
Africa,
continuously recording forest sounds around the clock. The collaboration aims
at developing an advanced sound analyzer capable of processing these extensive
audio recordings at high speed, allowing for the analysis of terabytes of audio
data in just a few days.
Making it possible to automatically detect and localize elephant rumbles from
the large amount of audio data.

An audio analyzer capable of automatically detecting elephant rumbles can
significantly enhance conservation efforts for forest elephants. Here are
several key benefits:

### Improved Monitoring and Data Collection

- __Continuous Surveillance:__ An audio analyzer can operate 24/7, providing
   continuous monitoring of elephant populations. This is especially useful in
   the dense and often inaccessible rainforests of Central Africa.
- __Non-Invasive Tracking:__ Unlike traditional tracking methods, audio
   monitoring is non-invasive and does not disturb the elephants or their
   natural behaviors.

### Enhanced Understanding of Elephant Behavior

- __Behavioral Insights:__ Detecting and analyzing rumbles can provide
 insights into elephant communication, social structures, and movement
 patterns.
- __Stress and Distress Signals:__ By recognizing specific types of rumbles,
 conservationists can identify signs of stress or distress, potentially
 indicating threats such as poaching or human-elephant conflicts.

### Anti-Poaching Efforts

- __Real-Time Alerts:__ An audio analyzer can send real-time alerts when
 elephant rumbles are detected, enabling rapid response to potential poaching
 activities.
- __Poaching Hotspot Identification:__ By analyzing data over time, it is
 possible to identify patterns and hotspots of poaching activity, allowing
 for more targeted and effective anti-poaching strategies.

### Habitat Usage and Movement Patterns

- __Spatial Analysis:__ Understanding where and when elephants are active
 can help in mapping their habitats and migration routes.
- __Resource Management:__ This information is crucial for managing
 protected areas, ensuring that resources are allocated effectively to areas
 where elephants are most vulnerable.

## Developed tools

[Open source
tools](https://github.com/earthtoolsmaker/forest-elephants-rumble-detection)
were developed during this project to process large amounts of audio data in
batch, leveraging multiprocessing to localize forest elephant rumbles with high
accuracy. The aim is to enable rapid analysis of large-scale audio datasets,
potentially reaching terabyte scales, by optimizing processing speed and
efficiency through the use of maximum CPU and GPU cores. Benchmark analyses
show that processing a 24-hour audio file on an 8-core CPU takes approximately
35 seconds, while using a GPU (T4) and an 8-core CPU reduces the time to
approximately 20 seconds.

Analyzing 1TB of data - approximately 1 month of audio recordings for the 50
recorders - would require __14.6 hours__ with CPUs, but only __8.3 hours__
using the GPU and CPU cores.

## Conclusion

In summary, an audio analyzer that detects elephant rumbles offers numerous
advantages for the conservation of forest elephants. It provides continuous,
non-invasive monitoring, enhances our understanding of elephant behavior, aids
in anti-poaching efforts, informs habitat management, supports research,
