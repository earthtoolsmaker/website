Brown bears, especially, possess charisma and play pivotal roles as both
indicator and umbrella species. Contributing to their understanding and
protection directly benefits the environment's overall health. Nonetheless,
monitoring bears poses challenges due to their elusive and expansive habitats.
The available toolkit for non-invasive bear research is restricted, resulting
in a diminished grasp of their population dynamics and trends.

## Bears are vital for healthy ecosystems

Bears play a crucial role in maintaining healthy ecosystems due to their
position as apex predators and their significant influence on various
ecological processes. Here are several reasons why bears are vital for
ecosystem health:

- __Regulation of Prey Populations:__ As apex predators, bears help control
   populations of prey species such as deer, elk, and fish. By regulating these
populations, bears prevent overgrazing and maintain the balance of plant
communities, which in turn affects other species dependent on those plants.
- __Seed Dispersal:__ Bears are omnivores and consume a diverse diet,
   including fruits, berries, and nuts. As they travel through their habitats,
bears inadvertently scatter seeds through their feces, helping to disperse
plant species and promote biodiversity.
- __Nutrient Cycling:__ When bears catch prey or forage for food, they often
   leave behind carcasses or plant remains. These organic materials provide
nutrients to the soil and support the growth of vegetation. Additionally, bear
feces contribute to nutrient cycling by enriching the soil with nitrogen,
phosphorus, and other essential elements.
- __Ecosystem Engineering:__ Bears are known to engage in behaviors that shape
   their environment, such as excavating dens or overturning logs in search of
food. These activities can have cascading effects on ecosystem dynamics by
creating habitats for other species or influencing nutrient cycling.
- __Indicator Species:__ Bears serve as indicators of ecosystem health. Their
   presence, abundance, and behavior can provide insights into the overall
condition of the ecosystem, including factors such as habitat quality, food
availability, and human impacts.

Overall, the presence of bears in an ecosystem signifies a healthy and balanced
environment. Protecting and conserving bear populations is not only essential
for their survival but also for the integrity and resilience of the ecosystems
they inhabit.

## Conservation concerns

Conservation concerns for brown bears stem from various factors that threaten
their populations and habitats. Some of the key reasons include:

- __Habitat Loss and Fragmentation:__ Human activities such as deforestation,
   urbanization, agriculture, and infrastructure development have led to the
loss and fragmentation of brown bear habitats. As their habitats shrink and
become fragmented, brown bears face challenges in finding suitable areas for
foraging, denning, and breeding.
- __Human-Wildlife Conflict:__ Encounters between brown bears and humans often
   result in conflicts, particularly in regions where humans have encroached
upon bear habitats. Conflicts arise due to predation on livestock, crop damage,
and perceived threats to human safety. In response, bears may be persecuted
through hunting or lethal control measures, further exacerbating conservation
concerns.
- __Illegal Poaching and Trade:__ Brown bears are targeted by poachers for
   their body parts, including fur, claws, and organs, which are used in
traditional medicine, cultural practices, or as trophies. Illegal poaching and
trade contribute to population declines and disrupt ecosystem dynamics.
- __Climate Change:__ Climate change is altering brown bear habitats by
   affecting food availability, altering vegetation patterns, and impacting
hibernation behaviors. Changes in climate can lead to mismatches in the timing
of key events, such as denning and berry ripening, which can negatively impact
brown bear populations.
- __Habitat Degradation:__ Human activities such as mining, logging, and
   recreational activities can degrade brown bear habitats through habitat
destruction, pollution, and disturbance. Degraded habitats may not be able to
support healthy brown bear populations or provide essential resources for their
survival.
- __Inadequate Legal Protections:__ In some regions, brown bears may lack
   adequate legal protections or face weak enforcement of existing conservation
laws. This can result in unchecked exploitation, habitat destruction, and other
threats to brown bear populations.

Addressing these conservation concerns requires concerted efforts involving
habitat protection, mitigating human-wildlife conflicts, combating illegal
poaching and trade, implementing climate adaptation strategies, and promoting
policies that ensure the long-term survival of brown bears and their habitats.

## How can a Bear Identification system benefit conservation?

- __Population Estimation and Migration Patterns:__ Automated bear
   identification aids in tracking population trends over time and
understanding bear movements, which informs conservation efforts and habitat
management.
- __Behavioral Research:__ Enables the study of social interactions, mating
   behaviors, and reproductive dynamics, crucial for effective conservation
strategies.
- __Land Management:__ Informs habitat protection, wildlife corridor
   establishment, and sustainable land-use planning to support bear populations
and biodiversity.
- __Human-Wildlife Conflict Resolution:__ Identifies high-conflict areas,
   informs proactive measures like bear-proofing, and evaluates the
effectiveness of coexistence strategies.

## Project Scope and Objectives

The primary objective of our collaboration is to pioneer non-invasive tools to
support bear research, monitoring, and conservation efforts. Our overarching
aim is to design a low power open-source model that can accurately identify
individual bears with an accuracy surpassing 90%.

Presently, the existing face recognition system achieves a top-1 accuracy of
64.9% and a top-5 accuracy of
70.7%.

__Note__: Top-5 accuracy measures the model's performance by considering the N
highest probability predictions it generates. If any of these predictions
matches the true label, the model deems the prediction as correct.

## Addressing Challenges in Brown Bear Identification

Brown bears offer an excellent opportunity to extend facial recognition
technology beyond primates, presenting both unique possibilities and challenges
that likely apply to a diverse range of species:

- __Inconsistent Pelage Markings:__ Unlike many species with distinctive fur
   patterns, brown bears lack consistent and unique markings, making facial
recognition a valuable alternative for individual identification.
- __Morphological Variation:__ Their morphology varies significantly across
   different habitats and geographic regions, posing a challenge for developing
a universally applicable recognition system.
- __Seasonal and Age-related Changes:__ Brown bears undergo substantial weight
   fluctuations between seasons and throughout their lifespan, necessitating
adaptive algorithms capable of accounting for these variations in facial
appearance.

## Camera Traps

The advent of camera traps has transformed wildlife observation and research,
enabling unprecedented insights into behavioral ecology and facilitating
citizen science census projects. These non-invasive monitoring tools offer the
advantage of data collection without human presence, minimizing stress on the
observed individuals. From the Arctic tundra to tropical rainforests, camera
traps have proven versatile, facilitating the study of a diverse range of
species. Initially designed for game scouting, camera traps have evolved
significantly to become indispensable tools for wildlife research, driving
advancements in design, functionality, and affordability.

## Developed Tools

Open source tools were developed during this project. The system
comprises two Machine Learning models that perform the following tasks:

1. __Instance Segmentation:__ This model localizes the head of a bear in a
camera trap picture. It produces a segmented and normalized image of the bear
face.

2. __Metric Learning:__ Segmented bear faces from the previous model are
embedded as points in a high-dimensional vector space. This embedding enables
clustering of similar individuals and ensures dissimilar ones are distant from
each other.
