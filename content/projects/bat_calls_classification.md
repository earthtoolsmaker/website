## Context

Bats are common throughout Cambodia, and are highly visible features of various
pagoda and national monuments, which often host colonies of fruit bats such as
Lyle’s flying fox, one of 31 species endemic to southeast Asia.

Bats play critical roles within their ecosystems, particularly in pest control,
seed dispersal, and pollination of various plants including many fruit trees.

Cambodia is the only known country with an ancient tradition of bat cultivation
for guano production, which remains in practice today. The lack of reliable
data and limited number of studies have left a dearth of knowledge of these
important creatures and hampers conservation efforts. The use of bats for
illegal bush meat and traditional medicine trade as well as rapidly
disappearing habitat and use of pesticides are causing declines in bat
population and put several species at risk of extinction. Cambodia’s
biodiversity remains understudied, and this is particularly true for bats, with
very limited research published. 

While the neighboring countries of Thailand and Vietnam both have over 100 bat
species recorded, ten years ago Cambodia only had 30 species recorded. Today,
Cambodia is known to have over 70 species of bat, with five of those new to
science. Just last year a new species of bat—the Hayes' thick-thumbed
myotis—was identified after being caught in the capital city of Phnom Penh.

The __Cambodia Urban Bat Project__ will use __citizen science__ volunteers to
make acoustic recordings of the bats while walking and riding transects in a
diversity of urban spaces, but particularly those known to be frequented by
bats. Citizen scientists will also do stationary recordings in hotspots that
are identified by the surveys.

## Project Scope and Objectives

Our partnership is focused on developing
Pytorch-Wildlife bioacoustics features for
classification of
bat calls. This would enable better understanding and
protection of bats by enabling researchers to
easily visualize and classification the large number of
bat call recordings gathered by the citizen
science community and shared made publicly available to all for further
research on iNaturalist as well as potentially other platforms or research
publications.
