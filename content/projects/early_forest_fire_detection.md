Pyronear presents a comprehensive fire risk management
solution. At its core, Pyronear integrates an advanced
early wildfire detection algorithm, seamlessly executed
on a compact microcomputer. This system is strategically
complemented by a network of high-resolution cameras
strategically positioned atop elevated vantage points,
offering panoramic views of forested areas. Together,
these components form a robust and proactive approach to
wildfire prevention and management.

> Our detectors communicate fire alerts to a database that is connected
> to a supervision platform for the fire department.

## Forests Protection

Protecting forests from fire is crucial for several reasons:

- __Biodiversity Conservation:__ Forests are home to a
vast array of plant and animal species. Wildfires can
devastate habitats, leading to the loss of biodiversity
and potentially driving species to extinction.
- __Carbon Sequestration:__ Forests act as carbon sinks,
absorbing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and storing
it in trees and soil. When forests burn, this stored
carbon is released back into the atmosphere,
exacerbating climate change.
- __Water Resources:__ Healthy forests play a critical
role in regulating water cycles. They help maintain soil
moisture, reduce erosion, and sustain the flow of rivers
and streams. Wildfires can disrupt these processes,
leading to soil degradation and affecting water quality
and availability.

- __Economic Impact:__ Forests provide various ecosystem
services, including timber, non-timber forest products,
and recreational opportunities. Wildfires can damage
these resources, impacting industries such as forestry,
tourism, and agriculture, leading to economic losses for
communities.
- __Human Health:__ Wildfires produce smoke and air
pollution, which can pose significant health risks,
especially to vulnerable populations such as children,
the elderly, and individuals with respiratory
conditions. Protecting forests from fire helps safeguard
public health and well-being.

Overall, preserving forests from fire is essential for
maintaining ecological balance, mitigating climate
change, sustaining livelihoods, and safeguarding human
health and biodiversity.

## Project Scope and Objectives

Our partnership is focused on enhancing the precision of
our early forest fire detection system, with the goal of
minimizing false alarms to bolster confidence among
firefighters and stakeholders. Additionally, we aspire
to incorporate industry-leading methodologies for
effectively managing, deploying, and maintaining Machine
Learning Models, ensuring optimal performance and
reliability over time.
