In this blog post we'll delve into the technical
development of a bear face recognition system which is a
critical component of the bear identification
system developed in close collaboration with the [BearID
Project](https://bearresearch.org/) NGO.

> Our research and software tool will provide a replicable technique and
> general approach that can be applied to other species beyond bears, which
> could aid conservation efforts worldwide.

## Project Scope

While many species boast distinctive fur patterns for identification,
brown bears lack consistent and unique markings. Furthermore, their
weight can fluctuate significantly between seasons and throughout their
lifetimes. Consequently, facial recognition emerges as a valuable
alternative for individual identification.

In this article, our attention is directed towards the final phase of
the bear identification system, specifically the recognition of bear
faces.

The initial stage entails acquiring a mapping capable of embedding bear
faces into a high-dimensional space, facilitating the clustering of
individuals.

Subsequently, we leverage this learned mapping to execute queries and
retrieve the closest matching individuals.
