In this blog post we'll delve into the technical
development of a bear face recognition system which is a
critical component of the bear identification
system developed in close collaboration with the [BearID
Project](https://bearresearch.org/) NGO.

> Our research and software tool will provide a replicable technique and

## Project Scope

While many species boast distinctive fur patterns for identification,
brown bears lack consistent and unique markings. Furthermore, their
weight can fluctuate significantly between seasons and throughout their
lifetimes. Consequently, facial recognition emerges as a valuable
alternative for individual identification.

In this article, our attention is directed towards the final phase of
the bear identification system, specifically the recognition of bear
faces.

The initial stage entails acquiring a mapping capable of embedding bear
faces into a high-dimensional space, facilitating the clustering of
individuals.

Subsequently, we leverage this learned mapping to execute queries and
retrieve the closest matching individuals.

Our collaboration with [The BearID Project](https://bearresearch.org)
aims to significantly enhance their current model performance, which
currently stands at precision (top-1): 0.649 and precision (top-5): 0.707.

## Provided Dataset

The [BearID Project](https://bearresearch.org) has compiled a collection
of bear images, showcasing their facial features,
captured over recent years in forests across British Columbia and Brooks
Falls.

After the development of the bear face segmentation system, as detailed
in [a prior blog post]({{< ref
"posts/bear-face-segmentation-guide" >}}), we successfully
generated approximately 4700 bear face images,
representing a total of 132 individuals.

### Bursts of images

When encountering a bear, photographs or camera traps often capture
multiple images of the same individual in very similar poses. Proper
handling of these bursts of images during data splitting is crucial.
Neglecting this step may lead to train/test data leakage, which can
cause the model to inaccurately overreport its performance.

### Individual counts distribution

The curated dataset primarily consists of only a few image faces for
most bears, posing a potential challenge for accurate identification.
Conversely, some bears have hundreds of image faces, largely derived
from bursts of images captured during encounters. Below, we present a
distribution plot of individual counts to provide further insight into
the data.
