In this blog post we'll explore the development process of a state of the art
early forest fire detector, created in partnership with the NGO
[Pyronear](https://pyronear.org).

> Our detectors communicate fire alerts to a database that is connected
> to a supervision platform for the fire department.

### Hardware setup

The Pyronear team developped a plug and play system composed of a central processor unit made of a Raspberry Pi connected to 4 cameras that cover 360 degrees angle to process input images around the clock.

#### Setting up the Pyronear system at Fontainebleau

The computer vision model detects a forest fire in Fontainebleau from a distance of 35 kilometers in real time. Setting a new record for the Pyronear systems.
